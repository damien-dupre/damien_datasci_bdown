ABSTRACT: With the development of wearable sensors, it is now possible to assess the dynamic progression of physiological rhythms such as heart rate, breathing rate or galvanic skin response in ways and places and during certain activities that were previously not possible due to cost and reliability. This paper investigates the physiological changes when participating in a zipline activity. Despite the advances in sensor technology, the statistical analysis of such physiological signals remains a challenge for data analysts. This paper presents a workflow encompassing the whole process with the goal of obtaining a range of best fitting models to analyse the patterns given by these measurements “in the wild”.
