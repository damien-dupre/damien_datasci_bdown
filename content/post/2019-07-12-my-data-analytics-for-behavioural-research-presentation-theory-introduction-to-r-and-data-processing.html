<p>I was recently asked to give a 3 sessions lecture about Data Analytics for Behavioural Research. As it is difficult to have a broader topic, Iâ€™ve decied to present my favorite research topic: the data science of emotions. These three different lecture present very quickly:
1. the current theories of emotions
2. how to use R
3. how to use R for emotion data processing</p>
<p>You will find my slides and code on my github or hereafter. Enjoy!</p>
