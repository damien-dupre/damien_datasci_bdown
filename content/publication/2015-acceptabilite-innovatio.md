abstract = "Anticipating the success of a product is a key issue for manufacturers, particularly in the case of an innovative product. To reduce the risk of being rejected by its target users, the field of psychology has examined the determinants of the emotional user experience generated by a product. The emotion felt by the user is indeed a key factor that will influence the use of a product. This paper presents the different methods for measuring emotions. A literature review will compare the studies measuring the emotions of potential product users, the type of measures they use and their main results. This literature review reveals that despite the importance of measuring the emotions of users to predict the success of products, few of them are performed on real products on the one hand and with a hypothetical-deductive approach on the other. Although the factor structure of emotional user experience is not yet explored, this framework is relevant for understanding the role of users’ emotions in their adoption of innovative products."
