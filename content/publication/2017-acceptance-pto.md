abstract = "To anticipate a product commercial success, companies aim to ensure that product's characteristics are involving users and triggering a positive first user experience as well as all along product's life span. Among these characteristics, triggering users’ emotions is particularly relevant. This article aims to present the different approaches integrating the emotion generated by products. In order to illustrate the emotional potential of certain products a selection of 14 photographs of products was evaluated by 87 participants. Results reveal a significant correlation between cognitive, motivational and subjective components of emotions. A reflexion about the integration of cognitive appraisal assessment and motivational action readiness evaluation into a wilder emotional model is provided. Thus, emotions triggered by a product appear to be a stake for designers and an important variable to introduce in acceptability or user experience models."
