abstract = "This paper describes Oudjat, a new software for the manual annotation of stimuli involved in facial expressions of emotion (FEE) recognition experiments. Taking into account advantages and weaknesses of existing software and keeping in mind the different specifications needed for annotation experiments, Oudjat provides a tradeoff between existing tools. For investigators, it is an easy-to-configure interface to set up relevant behaviors to be annotated. For annotators, it is an easy-to-use interface. This tool can perform complex annotations procedures with multiple responses panels such as buttons, scales as Likert scales, and free labeling. Oudjat also allows to chain response panels or to conduct sequence marking annotations (i.e. two-steps temporal annotation). As it can be configured in any language, Oudjat is particularly suited for intercultural experiments. Four annotation procedures are presented to illustrate Oudjat possibilities with FEE annotation. Oudjat is an open source software available to the scientific community and can be obtained on request."
