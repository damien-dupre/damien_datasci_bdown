With the advancement of technologies and with the help of unexpected game changer events, the future of learning is becoming online rather than onsite. This is particularly true for learning how to code (here is a nice book about Education in Data Science with R) . Coding languages such as R or Python require a combination of contextual situations to be efficiently practiced:\nLearners need to see the output of running code. Classic slides lectures are good for general ideas but nothing can replace the direct feedback of run a code and comparing its output with expected results.\n\rLearners need to practice. Because the first will generally not produce the expected results, learners have to use the good old ‚Äúdie and retry‚Äù strategy to understand their errors. However it takes time and auto determination.\n\rLearners need to follow their own rhythm. Depending on learners‚Äô previous experiences, the basics will be learnt faster or slower. All learners have their own pace.\n\r\rConsequently, online learning is perfect for these 3 points. In the R community, I imagine that most people have actually learnt R online, at least it is my case.\nLearning R online\rThere is a lot of amazing tutorials out there which can be accessed for free on coursera or udermy platforms for example or using blogs and online books. It is also very easy to create your own tutorial using {blogdown} or {bookdown} for example. A great talk entitled ‚ÄúHow to Get Your Materials Online With R Markdown‚Äù recently introduced the different possibilities to share your own tutorial online (here are the video and the slides).\rHowever, few of these solutions are satisfying the first criteria. The ability to let the learners running the code by themselves usually imply that the learner has to run the code on a machine with the code and IDE required already installed.\nOne of these online learning platform is different, it allows the learner to watch a video or to read some slides and then to run the code via some exercises. I learnt a lot from this platform but the access of the tutorials is not free and therefore not suitable for students.\n\rInteractive tutorials R packages\rThe community around R has developed some amazing tools to create tutorials which allow learners to run their own code. There are maybe more of them but I am thinking of the {learnr} and {RTutor} packages (the {swirl} package also creates tutorials but these have to be used inside an IDE).\nThe {learnr} package is amazing. It helps to create very neat interactive tutorials from a .Rmd file. Because I love Rmarkdown, I have created some of them already for my students:\n\rWaRm Up!\rData Transformation\rData Visualisation\rLinear Regression\r\rIt is also possible to integrate the {learnr} package into a blogdown website and to create beautiful visualisation such as the giraffe project to learn statistics.\rI have never used the {RTutor} package but I‚Äôm assuming it has a lot of similarities with the {learnr} package as indicated in this blog post.\rThe {learnr} package is very nice but it has a major problem, the learners need to have their own and unique shiny session. To run a .Rmd file using the {learnr} package, this Rmarkdown has to be deployed on a shiny server and I currently know only two solutions to host a shiny app:\n1. With RStudio‚Äôs shinyapps.io\rThis option is super easy and fast to deploy a shiny app and has a free option to deploy 5 shiny apps (that I currently use for my {learnr} tutorials). However, this free option also only includes 5 users in the same time. This is great for the test of specific shiny apps but for parallel learning, it is definitely not enough.\nThere is the possibility to increase the number of parallel users but it is not free I‚Äôm afraid.\n\r2. With a cloud instance using shiny server\rThe second solution involves creating a cloud instance on AWS or DigitalOcean for example and installing the shiny server to host the Rmarkdown with {learnr}. This solution involves some patience, a bit of knowledge in shell coding and is basically not free (some providers give a free tiers but only for a limited period of time). About the scalability of these solutions, it is apparently possible to scale it to multiple learners in parallel, but I never used them for this purpose so I can‚Äôt tell more about how to do it and how many parallel users can use the shiny app.\nFrom what I know, there are two solutions to run a shiny app online which can scale up more than 5 users in the same time and unfortunately none of them are completely free (however I need to explore this AWS free tier solution).\nI‚Äôm sure that there are alternative solutions and hacks that I am not aware of. For example AWS has so many different services that are a mystery to me. Would it be possible to set a shiny app in an AWS ECS container or to create a lambda with a R environment? My knowledge in AWS competitors such as DigitalOcean, Microsoft Azure or Google Cloud is not good enough to suggest alternative free awesome solutions.\n\r\rScale Docker containers with Binder\rI recently came across the post of by Florencia d‚ÄôAndrea explaining how to create an interactive tutorial with Binder, a free service which creates a scalable docker R environment attached to a github/gitlab repository. According to binder, the limit is 100 users simultaneously with is perfect for teaching!\nIn fact, I was already aware of online tutorial using this setup without knowing how they worked:\n\rGeneralized Additive Models in R by Noam Ross\rSupervised Machine Learning Case Studies in R by Julia Silge\rR-Bootcamp by Ted Laderas and Jessica Minnier\r\rBy following Florencia‚Äôs it is possible to create an interactive R tutorial for free very easily! The procedure described by Florencia and the three interactive tutorials examples as well as mine, are using the framework developed by Ines Montani called Juniper which will make the interface between the Binder docker R environment back end and the tutorial front end. Speaking of front end, Ines is providing a very fancy template using node.js and being deployed with Gatsby. At this point I‚Äôm throwing computer science jargon but my understanding of them is very limited. The most important is that it is working very well!\nIt‚Äôs not a perfect solution, see this blog post describing pros and cons for this solution, however it is working and for free.\n\rInteractive {blogdown} using ThebeLab‚Äôs Framework\rEven if Juniper‚Äôs framework is amazing, the content published is based on markdown files. I have nothing against markdown files but I do love Rmarkdown and I really missed them while publishing the tutorials. For this reason I googled ‚Äúblogdown‚Äù + ‚Äúbinder‚Äù and found two very interesting discussions:\n\rThe first that I found was initiated here in a question about the interactivity of bookdown documents. Someone came across the activity of ThebeLab which is providing interfaces to binder for python code (see examples here and here. This question was answered by Christophe Dervieux saying that binder was not supporting R at this time. Christophe definitely made some progress when he shared in this tweet his success in creating an interactive .Rmd\rThe second discussion was on gitter.com initiated by Achintya Rao saying that he successfully managed to create an interactive blogdown.\r\rAfter being in contact with Achintya and by seeing Christophe‚Äôs code, it is possible to identify the essential component to make magic happened:\nThe blogdown theme or the .Rmd file need to include a code linking it to the repository connected to the binder docker R environment and to the package thebelab which is interacting between both.\r\rIn Christophe‚Äôs code, this html code is included directly in the .Rmd file:\n\u0026lt;!-- Some stuff from thebelab required for the magic --\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;!-- Configure and load Thebe !--\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;script type=\u0026quot;text/x-thebe-config\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\r{\rrequestKernel: true,\rbinderOptions: {\rrepo: \u0026#39;github_username/github_reponame,\r},\rkernelOptions: {\rname: \u0026quot;R\u0026quot;,\rkernelName: \u0026quot;ir\u0026quot;,\r},\r}\r\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;!-- script for thebelab --\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;script src=\u0026quot;https://unpkg.com/thebelab@latest/lib/index.js\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt;\rWhereas for Achintya‚Äôs blogdown, the following code is included in a specific file ./themes/hugo-lithium/layouts/partials/head_custom.html:\n\u0026lt;!-- Configure and load Thebe !--\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;script type=\u0026quot;text/x-thebe-config\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\r{\rbootstrap: false,\rrequestKernel: true,\rbinderOptions: {\rrepo: \u0026#39;github_username/github_reponame,\rref: \u0026#39;master\u0026#39;,\rrepoProvider: \u0026#39;github\u0026#39;,\r},\rkernelOptions: {\rname: \u0026#39;ir\u0026#39;,\r}\r}\r\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;script src=\u0026quot;https://unpkg.com/thebelab@0.4.0/lib/index.js\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt;\rBoth document are including a button to activate the code.\r\rIn Christophe‚Äôs code the button code and its action on the bootstrapThebe function are directly included in the Rmd file:\n# ad a button\rhtmltools::tags$button(\rid = \u0026quot;activateButton\u0026quot;,\rstyle=\u0026quot;width: 100px; height: 50px; font-size: 1.5em;\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Activate\u0026quot;\r)\r# js chunk\r// thebelab js script\rvar bootstrapThebe = function() {\rthebelab.bootstrap();\r}\rdocument.querySelector(\u0026quot;#activateButton\u0026quot;).addEventListener(\u0026#39;click\u0026#39;, bootstrapThebe)\rFor Achintya‚Äôs blogdown, the code to create the button is included in a specific file ./themes/hugo-lithium/layouts/shortcodes/code.html and the code to trigger the bootstrapThebe is included in a specific file ./themes/hugo-lithium/layouts/partials/code.html. But to link these html files with the Rmd, each blogdown blog post have to include the following code:\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = TRUE, attr.source=\u0026quot;data-executable=\u0026#39;true\u0026#39;\u0026quot;,\reval = FALSE)\r\rAdding the link to the repository connected to binder\rI have hidden it to make it more generic and explicit but Christophe used the demo repo connected to binder https://github.com/binder-examples/r whereas Achintya has linked his blogdown to a repository hosted on his github.\nIn fact, the necessity of connecting a repository to binder and to indicate the link to this repository is also used in Juniper in a very similar way. However, instead of having a separated repository, Ines was connecting a branch of the same repository used for the deployment. From my github beginner experience, I think a distinct repository is easier to manage.\nThe necessity of having a distinct branch or repository is explained by Ines as follow in the readme of her template: ‚ÄúThe reason they‚Äôre different is that binder forces a Docker container rebuild when a branch is updated. So, if we served our container out of master, it would rebuild every time we modified a chapter.md or an exercise.‚Äù\nTo build this binder docker image from a repository it is super easy, you just need two files on the root of the repository:\n\ra R script which contains all the package to install in order to run the code in your interactive chunks\ra text file containing YYYY-MM-DD snapshot at MRAN that will be used for installing libraries. See here for details.\rThe you just need to go to binder.org fill your repository url and branch (if not master) and this is it!\r\rYou can have a look at this blogdown test containing interactive code chunks here (this blogdown works in the same way as Achintya‚Äôs so but it is hosted on my github repository and uses a binder docker image connected to my github repository as well).\nAnd this his what Christope‚Äôs setup looks like:\r{\rrequestKernel: true,\rbinderOptions: {\rrepo: \"binder-examples/r\",\r},\rkernelOptions: {\rname: \"R\",\rkernelName: \"ir\",\r},\r}\r\r\r\rclicking the below button will also launch the kernel and that could take some\rtimes to strat. Be patient‚Ä¶\n\rActivate\r// thebelab js script\rvar bootstrapThebe = function() {\rthebelab.bootstrap();\r}\rdocument.querySelector(\"#activateButton\").addEventListener('click', bootstrapThebe)\r\rHere is a chunk, not evaluated on purpose by Rmarkdown, and to be executed interactively, directly in this document.\nprint(\u0026quot;Hello\u0026quot;)\r\rNext steps\rFor the moment, thanks to Achintya and Christophe‚Äôs work, I have a blog test will 2 code chunks that are interactive. The next move will be to convert my Juniper-mardown-node.js tutorial to a thebelab ‚Äìrmarkdown-blogdown.\nAnother interesting part would be to integrate a code evaluation system like {gradethis} for example. I‚Äôm also wondering if {learnr} would work as well!\n\r","date":1586304000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1586364764,"objectID":"9be5a691b0b77ed7df521b57109d74ad","permalink":"/post/how-to-make-an-interactive-tutorial-to-teach-r-an-overview/","publishdate":"2020-04-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/how-to-make-an-interactive-tutorial-to-teach-r-an-overview/","section":"post","summary":"Learning is changing quickly, very quickly.

One of the most challenging part is to find a venue. Indeed there are a lot of them but some are already booked for your date. So, in order to check if a venue is already booked I‚Äôll show you how I made a list of possible venues with google search API, stored the list on google drive, web scrap for their emails and send them with R.\nSetup\r# store passwords\rlibrary(config)\r# data wrangling\rlibrary(plyr)\rlibrary(tidyverse)\rlibrary(purrr)\rlibrary(glue)\r# google APIs\rlibrary(googleway)\rlibrary(googledrive)\r# webscraping\rlibrary(rvest)\r# send emails\rlibrary(mailR)\rlibrary(XML)\rlibrary(RCurl)\r# html widgets\rlibrary(DT)\rlibrary(leaflet)\rknitr::opts_chunk$set(cache.extra = knitr::rand_seed, message = FALSE,warning = FALSE, error = FALSE)\rset.seed(123)# Seed for random number generation\roptions(scipen=999)# Disable scientific number format\rgmail_wedding \u0026lt;- config::get(\u0026quot;gmail_wedding\u0026quot;)\rgoogle_key \u0026lt;- config::get(\u0026quot;google_cloud\u0026quot;)\r\rList of Venues with google place API\rBecause almost everything is possible in R thanks to our awesome community, I was thinking of getting a list of venues from google. And thankfully there is a package to do that called googleway. Google API has many different services related to geocoding such as Direction API, Geolocalisation API or Place API which I‚Äôm using to get venues from search key words. To use it you just need to register on google cloud your Credit/Debit Card to obtain an API key, but no worries if you use the service in a gentle way, that won‚Äôt cost you anything. I found a very useful answer from stack overflow to use the googleway package.\nList of targeted cities\rI also don‚Äôt want to organize my wedding everywhere in France, I‚Äôd it to be in the Auvergne-Rhone-Alpes region which is a lovely area. So I wasn‚Äôt sure that by using the key word ‚ÄúAuvergne-Rhone-Alpes‚Äù I‚Äôll find all the venues I wanted, so I decided to loop the search on a list of cities in this region based on their department numbers.\ndept_target \u0026lt;- c(01,07,26,38,69,73,74)\r#\rlist_city \u0026lt;- read.csv(\rfile = url(\u0026quot;https://sql.sh/ressources/sql-villes-france/villes_france.csv\u0026quot;),\rheader = FALSE) %\u0026gt;%\rdplyr::select(dept = V2, city = V5, pop2010 = V15) %\u0026gt;%\rdplyr::mutate(city = as.character(city)) %\u0026gt;%\rdplyr::filter(dept %in% dept_target) %\u0026gt;% # filter by target departments\rdplyr::filter(pop2010 \u0026gt; 5000) %\u0026gt;% # filter by city population size\rmagrittr::use_series(city)\r\rQuerying google place API\rOnce the list of cities obtained, I made a loop to query Google place for these cities. A tricky part is to get the search results from other pages. If a ‚Äúnext_page_token‚Äù is found, an while statement is querying for this new page. If no result is found the loop goes to the next city.\ndf_places_final \u0026lt;- NULL\rfor(city in list_city){\r#print(city)\rdf_places \u0026lt;- googleway::google_places(\rsearch_string = paste(\u0026quot;mariage\u0026quot;, city, \u0026quot;france\u0026quot;), key = google_key$key) # replace by your Google API key\rif(length(df_places$results) == 0) next\rdf_places_results \u0026lt;- df_places$results\rgeometry \u0026lt;- df_places_results$geometry$location\rdf_places_results \u0026lt;- df_places_results[,c(\u0026quot;name\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;formatted_address\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;place_id\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;types\u0026quot;)]\rdf_places_results \u0026lt;- cbind(df_places_results,geometry)\rwhile (!is.null(df_places$next_page_token)) {\rdf_places \u0026lt;- googleway::google_places(\rsearch_string = paste(\u0026quot;mariage\u0026quot;, city, \u0026quot;france\u0026quot;),\rpage_token = df_places$next_page_token,\rkey = google_key$key)\rdf_places_next \u0026lt;- df_places$results\rif(length(df_places_next)\u0026gt;0){\rgeometry \u0026lt;- df_places_next$geometry$location\rdf_places_next \u0026lt;- df_places_next[,c(\u0026quot;name\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;formatted_address\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;place_id\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;types\u0026quot;)]\rdf_places_next \u0026lt;- cbind(df_places_next,geometry)\rdf_places_results \u0026lt;- rbind(df_places_results, df_places_next)\r}\rSys.sleep(2) # time to not overload the google API\r}\rdf_places_final \u0026lt;- rbind(df_places_final,df_places_results)\r}\rObviously in the search results we obtain not only wedding venues but also photographers, caterers, and wedding shops.

One advantage of Google is not only very easy email setup but also the access to a Google drive to store your documents in order to keep track.

In order to extract recurrent patterns, the randomness of the noise can sometimes simulate non meaningful pattern and then change the cluster structure. Because we are interested in classification of recurrent pattern, a nice thing would be to remove the noise. Noise removal analyses are probably the most important contribution of signal treatment research and many can be applied here such as seasonality decomposition, Hidden Markov Models and power spectrum analysis.\n\rDTW cluster with seasonality decomposition\rR for time series analysis have some unavoidable packages and functions. If you are interested in time series analysis, you probably cannot work without zoo::zoo(), xts::xts() or tibbletime::as_tbl_time(). However for time series analysis, the stats package have one of the most used and nice function: stl(). Stl allows a Seasonal Decomposition of Time Series by Loess which is powerful in order to extract time series noise, trend and seasonality (i.e periods). In our case we will try to use stl() in order to extract training plan seasonality over one week and then to cluster the results with the DTW method.\nSo first let‚Äôs apply the stl() decomposition to every time series in our master list.\nextract_seasonality \u0026lt;- function(x, robust){\rx_ts = ts(as.numeric(unlist(x)), frequency = 7)\rstl_test = stl(x_ts, s.window = 7, robust)\rreturn(stl_test$time.series[,1])\r}\r#\rplan_seasonality \u0026lt;- plan_list %\u0026gt;%\rpurrr::map(~extract_seasonality(., robust = TRUE))\rand then let‚Äôs process our model and to plot the results.\nNclust \u0026lt;- 2\rdtw_model \u0026lt;- dtwclust::tsclust(series = plan_seasonality, type = \u0026quot;h\u0026quot;, k = Nclust, distance = \u0026quot;dtw_basic\u0026quot;, control = hierarchical_control(method = \u0026quot;complete\u0026quot;),\rpreproc = NULL, #args = tsclust_args(dist = list(window.size = 5L)),\rtrace = TRUE)\r#\rdtw_data \u0026lt;- ggdendro::dendro_data(dtw_model, type=\u0026quot;rectangle\u0026quot;)\r#\rlabels_order \u0026lt;- dtw_data$labels$label\r#\rdtw_result \u0026lt;- data.frame(label = names(plan_seasonality), cluster = factor(stats::cutree(dtw_model, k = Nclust)))\r#\rdtw_data[[\u0026quot;labels\u0026quot;]] \u0026lt;- merge(dtw_data[[\u0026quot;labels\u0026quot;]], dtw_result, by=\u0026quot;label\u0026quot;)\rdtw_result \u0026lt;- dplyr::full_join(dtw_result,dtw_data$labels, by=c(\u0026quot;label\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;cluster\u0026quot;))%\u0026gt;%\rdplyr::arrange(x)\rcluster_box \u0026lt;- aggregate(x~cluster, ggdendro::label(dtw_data), range)\rcluster_box \u0026lt;- data.frame(cluster_box$cluster,cluster_box$x)\rcluster_threshold \u0026lt;- mean(dtw_model$height[length(dtw_model$height)-((Nclust-2):(Nclust-1))])\r#\rnumColors \u0026lt;- length(levels(dtw_result$cluster)) # How many colors you need\rgetColors \u0026lt;- scales::hue_pal() # Create a function that takes a number and returns a qualitative palette of that length (from the scales package)\rmyPalette \u0026lt;- getColors(numColors)\rnames(myPalette) \u0026lt;- levels(dtw_result$cluster) # Give every color an appropriate name\rp1 \u0026lt;- ggplot() + geom_rect(data=cluster_box, aes(xmin=X1-.3, xmax=X2+.3, ymin=0, ymax=cluster_threshold, color=cluster_box.cluster), fill=NA)+\rgeom_segment(data=ggdendro::segment(dtw_data), aes(x=x, y=y, xend=xend, yend=yend)) + coord_flip() + scale_y_continuous(\u0026quot;Distance\u0026quot;) + scale_x_continuous(\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,breaks = 1:20, labels = labels_order) + guides(color=FALSE, fill = FALSE)+\rtheme(\rpanel.grid.major = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), # remove grids\rpanel.background = element_blank(), axis.text.y = element_text(colour = myPalette[dtw_result$cluster],hjust=0.5),\raxis.ticks.y=element_blank()\r)\r#\rp2 \u0026lt;- as.data.frame(matrix(unlist(plan_seasonality), nrow=length(unlist(plan_seasonality[1])), dimnames = list(c(),names(plan_seasonality)))) %\u0026gt;%\rdplyr::mutate(rundatelocal = seq.Date(date_marathon-175, date_marathon-1, by=\u0026quot;day\u0026quot;)) %\u0026gt;%\rtidyr::gather(key = label,value = value, -rundatelocal) %\u0026gt;%\rdplyr::mutate(label = as.factor(label)) %\u0026gt;%\rdplyr::full_join(., dtw_result, by = \u0026quot;label\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;% mutate(label = factor(label, levels = rev(as.character(labels_order)))) %\u0026gt;%\rggplot(aes(x = rundatelocal, y = value, colour = as.factor(cluster))) +\rgeom_line() +\rgeom_area(aes(fill = as.factor(cluster))) +\rcoord_cartesian(ylim = c(-25,25)) +\rscale_y_continuous(name = \u0026quot;Seasonal distance per day [km]\u0026quot;, breaks = seq(-25, 25, by = 50)) +\rscale_x_date(name = \u0026quot;Run Date\u0026quot;, date_breaks = \u0026quot;4 week\u0026quot;, date_labels = \u0026quot;%b %d\u0026quot;) +\rfacet_wrap(~label, ncol = 1, strip.position=\u0026quot;left\u0026quot;) + guides(color=FALSE, fill = FALSE) +\rtheme_bw() + theme(strip.background = element_blank(), strip.text = element_blank())\r#\rplt_list \u0026lt;- list(p2, p1)\rplt_layout \u0026lt;- rbind(c(NA, 2),\rc(1, 2),\rc(NA, 2))\r#\rgrid.arrange(grobs = plt_list, layout_matrix = plt_layout, heights = c(0.04, 1, 0.05))\rWell that‚Äôs an epic fail I think but let‚Äôs have a look why. Different reasons can explain why we have a first cluster with only 3 time series and as second with all the 17 remaining ones:\nI am using only 2 clusters. In the real life (and in real randomness) a large amount of pattern is possible thus increasing the number of clusters can make the clustering more efficient (if an evaluation of the best fit with cluster number is performed).\rBy removing the noise in the random plan, I made them not random at all and we can see now the repetition of the patterns. This is exactly what I want in my research with real data but here it made a mess.\r\rSo let‚Äôs try another method!\n\rDTW cluster with Hidden Markov Model\rI‚Äôm not a perfect expert in Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and after having a look at the book Hidden Markov Models for Time Series An Introduction Using R by Walter Zucchini, Iain L. MacDonald and Roland Langrock, I can surely say that it is a complicated question. However in a nutshell HMM are clustering the values according their probability to be part of a ‚Äústate‚Äù. In our case, let‚Äôs say that we have three states possible per day ‚Äúno run‚Äù, ‚Äúmedium run‚Äù and ‚Äúlong run‚Äù. By using HMM it is possible to create new time series based on states instead on distance. It‚Äôs a qualitative transformation without any prior assumption about the states boundaries (almost).\nplan_HMM \u0026lt;- as.data.frame(matrix(unlist(plan_list), nrow=length(unlist(plan_list[1])), dimnames = list(c(),names(plan_list)))) %\u0026gt;%\rdplyr::mutate(rundatelocal = seq.Date(date_marathon-175, date_marathon-1, by=\u0026quot;day\u0026quot;)) %\u0026gt;%\rtidyr::gather(key = label,value = value, -rundatelocal) %\u0026gt;%\rdplyr::mutate(label = as.factor(label)) %\u0026gt;%\rdplyr::mutate(value = as.integer(value))\r#\rmod \u0026lt;- depmixS4::depmix(value~label, family = poisson(link = \u0026quot;log\u0026quot;), nstates = 3, data = plan_HMM)\r#\rfm \u0026lt;- depmixS4::fit(mod, verbose = FALSE)\r#\rprobs \u0026lt;- depmixS4::posterior(fm)\r#\rplan_HMM \u0026lt;- cbind(plan_HMM,probs) %\u0026gt;%\rdplyr::select(rundatelocal,label,state) %\u0026gt;%\rtidyr::spread(label,state) %\u0026gt;%\rdplyr::select(-rundatelocal) %\u0026gt;%\rpurrr::map(~(.))\rNclust \u0026lt;- 2\rdtw_model \u0026lt;- dtwclust::tsclust(series = plan_HMM, type = \u0026quot;h\u0026quot;, k = Nclust, distance = \u0026quot;dtw_basic\u0026quot;, control = hierarchical_control(method = \u0026quot;complete\u0026quot;),\rpreproc = NULL, #args = tsclust_args(dist = list(window.size = 5L)),\rtrace = TRUE)\r#\rdtw_data \u0026lt;- ggdendro::dendro_data(dtw_model, type=\u0026quot;rectangle\u0026quot;)\r#\rlabels_order \u0026lt;- dtw_data$labels$label\r#\rdtw_result \u0026lt;- data.frame(label = names(plan_HMM), cluster = factor(stats::cutree(dtw_model, k = Nclust)))\r#\rdtw_data[[\u0026quot;labels\u0026quot;]] \u0026lt;- merge(dtw_data[[\u0026quot;labels\u0026quot;]], dtw_result, by=\u0026quot;label\u0026quot;)\rdtw_result \u0026lt;- dplyr::full_join(dtw_result,dtw_data$labels, by=c(\u0026quot;label\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;cluster\u0026quot;))%\u0026gt;%\rdplyr::arrange(x)\rcluster_box \u0026lt;- aggregate(x~cluster, ggdendro::label(dtw_data), range)\rcluster_box \u0026lt;- data.frame(cluster_box$cluster,cluster_box$x)\rcluster_threshold \u0026lt;- mean(dtw_model$height[length(dtw_model$height)-((Nclust-2):(Nclust-1))])\r#\rnumColors \u0026lt;- length(levels(dtw_result$cluster)) # How many colors you need\rgetColors \u0026lt;- scales::hue_pal() # Create a function that takes a number and returns a qualitative palette of that length (from the scales package)\rmyPalette \u0026lt;- getColors(numColors)\rnames(myPalette) \u0026lt;- levels(dtw_result$cluster) # Give every color an appropriate name\rp1 \u0026lt;- ggplot() + geom_rect(data=cluster_box, aes(xmin=X1-.3, xmax=X2+.3, ymin=0, ymax=cluster_threshold, color=cluster_box.cluster), fill=NA)+\rgeom_segment(data=ggdendro::segment(dtw_data), aes(x=x, y=y, xend=xend, yend=yend)) + coord_flip() + scale_y_continuous(\u0026quot;Distance\u0026quot;) + scale_x_continuous(\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,breaks = 1:20, labels = labels_order) + guides(color=FALSE, fill = FALSE)+\rtheme(\rpanel.grid.major = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), # remove grids\rpanel.background = element_blank(), axis.text.y = element_text(colour = myPalette[dtw_result$cluster],hjust=0.5),\raxis.ticks.y=element_blank()\r)\r#\rp2 \u0026lt;- as.data.frame(matrix(unlist(plan_HMM), nrow=length(unlist(plan_HMM[1])), dimnames = list(c(),names(plan_HMM)))) %\u0026gt;%\rdplyr::mutate(rundatelocal = seq.Date(date_marathon-175, date_marathon-1, by=\u0026quot;day\u0026quot;)) %\u0026gt;%\rtidyr::gather(key = label,value = value, -rundatelocal) %\u0026gt;%\rdplyr::mutate(label = as.factor(label)) %\u0026gt;%\rdplyr::full_join(., dtw_result, by = \u0026quot;label\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;% mutate(label = factor(label, levels = rev(as.character(labels_order)))) %\u0026gt;%\rggplot(aes(x = rundatelocal, y = value, colour = as.factor(cluster))) +\rgeom_line() +\rgeom_area(aes(fill = as.factor(cluster))) +\rcoord_cartesian(ylim = c(0,4)) +\rscale_y_continuous(name = \u0026quot;States per day [km]\u0026quot;, breaks = seq(0, 4, by = 4)) +\rscale_x_date(name = \u0026quot;Run Date\u0026quot;, date_breaks = \u0026quot;4 week\u0026quot;, date_labels = \u0026quot;%b %d\u0026quot;) +\rfacet_wrap(~label, ncol = 1, strip.position=\u0026quot;left\u0026quot;) + guides(color=FALSE, fill = FALSE) +\rtheme_bw() + theme(strip.background = element_blank(), strip.text = element_blank())\r#\rplt_list \u0026lt;- list(p2, p1)\rplt_layout \u0026lt;- rbind(c(NA, 2),\rc(1, 2),\rc(NA, 2))\r#\rgrid.arrange(grobs = plt_list, layout_matrix = plt_layout, heights = c(0.04, 1, 0.05))\rGood news this time, the clusters are almost equally distributed, bad news random plans and pattern plans are mixed together. However we can see that the HMM is creating surprisingly nice pattern which can be easily clustered with a higher number of cluster. The drawback is the low distance between each time series which can make the clustering method more complicated.\n\rDTW cluster by power spectral density\rLast but not least, the probable best approach to evaluate seasonality/frequency in training plan pattern can be the power spectrum analysis. By identifying the underlying frequencies of each time series it is possible to cluster them according their pattern. A nice new package WaveletComp can be used for this purpose.

The best is to have real data to analyse but it can be very useful to simulate these pattern in order to assess the clustering efficiency.\nA simple way to simulate these time series is to use the sine function and to add a random noise in order to make it more credible.\n# classic run\rnoise \u0026lt;- runif(420) # random noise\rx \u0026lt;- seq(1,420) # 42km with a measure every 100m\rpace_min \u0026lt;- 5 # min/km (corresponds to fast run)\rts_sim_classic_run \u0026lt;- (sin(x/10)+x/100+noise+pace_min) %\u0026gt;%\ras.ts(.)\rts.plot(ts_sim_classic_run, xlab = \u0026quot;Distance [x100m]\u0026quot;, ylab = \u0026quot;Differential pace [min/km]\u0026quot;, main = \u0026quot;Example of classic run\u0026quot;, ylim=c(0,25))\r# wall run\rnoise \u0026lt;- runif(210) # random noise\rx \u0026lt;- seq(1,210) # 21km with a measure every 100m pace_min \u0026lt;- 5 # min/km (corresponds to fast run)\rpace_wall \u0026lt;- 20 # min/km (corresponds to very slow run) ts_sim_part1 \u0026lt;- sin(x/5)+x/50+noise+pace_min\rts_sim_part2 \u0026lt;- sin(x/5)+noise+pace_wall\rts_sim_wall_run \u0026lt;- c(ts_sim_part1,ts_sim_part2) %\u0026gt;%\ras.ts(.)\rts.plot(ts_sim_wall_run, xlab = \u0026quot;Distance [x100m]\u0026quot;, ylab = \u0026quot;Differential pace [min/km]\u0026quot;, main = \u0026quot;Example of wall run\u0026quot;, ylim=c(0,25))\rA much nicer way would be to use ARIMA with an auto regressive model (AR).\npace_min \u0026lt;- 5 # min/km (corresponds to fast run)\rpace_wall \u0026lt;- 20 # min/km (corresponds to very slow run) # classic run\rts_sim_classic_run \u0026lt;- abs(arima.sim(n = 420, mean = 0.001, model = list(order = c(1,0,0), ar = 0.9))) + pace_min\rts.plot(ts_sim_classic_run, xlab = \u0026quot;Distance [x100m]\u0026quot;, ylab = \u0026quot;Differential pace [min/km]\u0026quot;, main = \u0026quot;Example of classic run\u0026quot;, ylim=c(0,25))\r# wall run\rts_sim_part1 \u0026lt;- abs(arima.sim(n = 210, model = list(order = c(1,0,0), ar = 0.9))) + pace_min\rts_sim_part2 \u0026lt;- ts(arima.sim(n = 210, model = list(order = c(1,0,0), ar = 0.9)) + pace_wall, start = 211,end =420)\rts_sim_wall_run \u0026lt;- ts.union(ts_sim_part1,ts_sim_part2)\rts_sim_wall_run\u0026lt;- pmin(ts_sim_wall_run[,1], ts_sim_wall_run[,2], na.rm = TRUE)\rts.plot(ts_sim_wall_run, xlab = \u0026quot;Distance [x100m]\u0026quot;, ylab = \u0026quot;Differential pace [min/km]\u0026quot;, main = \u0026quot;Example of wall run\u0026quot;, ylim=c(0,25))\r\rBootstrap\rNow we have two different runs, let‚Äôs bootstrap them (i.e.¬†replicate with small differences) in order to have two groups of 5 individuals for each run type.\nts_sim_boot_classic \u0026lt;- ts_sim_classic_run %\u0026gt;%\rtseries::tsbootstrap(., nb=5, b=200, type = \u0026quot;block\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;%\ras.data.frame(.) %\u0026gt;%\rdplyr::rename_all(funs(c(paste0(\u0026quot;classic_\u0026quot;,.))))\rts_sim_boot_wall \u0026lt;- ts_sim_wall_run %\u0026gt;%\rtseries::tsbootstrap(., nb=5, b=350, type = \u0026quot;block\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;%\ras.data.frame(.) %\u0026gt;%\rdplyr::rename_all(funs(c(paste0(\u0026quot;wall_\u0026quot;,.))))\rts_sim_df \u0026lt;- cbind(ts_sim_boot_classic,ts_sim_boot_wall)\r\rHeatmap cluster\rEven if I‚Äôm a big fan of ggplot2 possibilities, some packages offer efficient ways to compute and plot data.

My first post to my website is about to be live on the web! I‚Äôm always amazed by the possibilities offered by R and Rstudio and my first lines will thank this huge community which make the awesomeness real. However it‚Äôs not always easy to use and to apply these magnificent tools. Publishing a blogdown is a good example of a process that looks easy on the first sight but which can be tricky. Here are some insights from my experience in publishing a research blog from blogdown.\nFirst steps with blogdown\rThe blogdown package is very well documented and if you are intended to publish your own websites the best approach is to have a look at the bookdown made by Yihui Xie, Amber Thomas and Alison Presmanes Hill blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown.\nSeveral tutorials are available to help new users in this case:\n\rA blog post writen by Alison Presmanes Hill, Up and running with blogdown, is a very good first step to blogdown. The post is well documented and will help to solve most of the major problems to setup a website.\rThe talk given by Yihui Xie at the rstudio::conf 2018, Create and maintain websites with R Markdown and blogdown, is short and very well presented.\rThe youtube tutorial by John Muschelli, Making a Website with Blogdown, presents all the steps from building a website to publishing it on netlify.com.\r\r\rProblem solving\rEven if the authors of blogdown made it very easy to publish a blog from Rstudio, some problem can be encountered while following the basic steps. Here is my experience in troubleshooting some of the problems that can happen.\nPrerequisite\rIn order to avoid the majority of the problems that may happen, it is essential to have the latest versions of R, Rstudio, blogdown package (don‚Äôt hesitate to use its GitHub version devtools::install_github(\u0026quot;rstudio/blogdown\u0026quot;)) and Hugo (blogdown::update_hugo()). Like mine, if the process of publishing a blogdown takes several weeks, upgrading to the latest version for every try can slove a lot of problems.\n\rCreating a GitHub connection\rIf one wants to make blogdown live on the web, a GitHub integration is the way to go according to me. Two routes are possible:\nCreating a blogdown project from Rstudio and then uploading the project on GitHub. Rstudio GUI is one of its main asset and creating a blogdown project from Rstudio is very easy but the connection with GitHub has to be done afterward which can lead to several problems when committing the changes.\rCreating an empty repo on GitHub, then creating a new project with version control on Rstudio and use the function blogdown::build_site() in this new project. This solution doesn‚Äôt look as straight forward but once it is done, the connection with GitHub is very stable.\r\r\rInstalling a new theme\rWhen it comes to build the site, it is possible to specify the theme you want to use with blogdown::new_site(theme = \u0026quot;gcushen/hugo-academic\u0026quot;). Even if the default theme is nice, researchers and students can find the theme ‚Äúacademic‚Äù more suitable. But be sure to have installed a version of Hugo that corresponds with the theme version of Hugo.\nAfter this initial command, the template website should be displayed in Rstudio viewer. If you have to close the project it is possible to relaunch this view using the Serve Site shortcut in Rstudio Addins or by using blogdown::serve_site(). Next step is the uploading of this template website in GitHub.\n\rMaking GitHub commit and push\rA big advantage of GitHub integration is that when your website is live on the web, any new post or new content is automatically uploaded with simple commit and push from Rstudio project. Rstudio provides a nice interface to do these commit and push to GitHub without using any command lines which is great for new coders and/or windows users. However with the initial commit and push of a blogdown I didn‚Äôt manage to use Rstudio GUI resulting of endless lags and multiple reboots. The solution is to use github commit and push from command lines.\nif you are new to command lines don‚Äôt be afraid, it is very easy:\nIf your project is linked with GitHub, that means Git is also installed and Git comes with a CMD prompt that can be used for manual commit and push to GitHub.\rChange the directory\r\rfrom C:\\Users\\MyName\u0026gt;\rto C:\\Users\\MyName\\MyFolderName\\MyBlogdownProjectName\u0026gt;\rusing cd .\\MyFolderName\\MyBlogdownProjectName.\r\rAdd all changes with the command git add -A.\rCommit these changes with the command git commit -m \u0026quot;initial commit text\u0026quot;.\rPush these changes to GitHub with the command git push.\r\rNote: these commands are the most basic ones, it can me more complicated to add only specific files or to push from another branch but in these cases you can easily find the commands on the web.\n\rPublishing the template to Netlify\rOnce this initial commit is done, it is possible to make the template live on Netlify. I think it is a good idea to not modify the template yet in order to first check how Netlify is handling the template website.\nOn Netlify, with GitHub login and password, it is easy to find you repo and to deploy the website. However Netlify will analyse the project and this can result in more errors and problems. The biggest problem that I had was solved very easily with the genius Mara Averick and her blog post Updating your version of Hugo for blogdown on Netlify. I should create a blog dedicated to how amazing Mara is and as usual she solved a massive problem. Indeed, Hugo‚Äôs theme have specific minimum Hugo version to use but even Rstudio is using the latest version to build the website, Netlify needs to know which version to use. The correct version must be set as a New variable with the key to HUGO_VERSION. Then the magic happens and the website is deployed to the world. the first URL address of the website is quite complicated but Netlify allows to change it for free.\n\rChanging the content of the template\rLast but not least, the website you have just published needs to be filled with your own content. The first step will be to replace all the lines in the sub-folder home with your own data and to delete all the posts, publications, citations, images, etc. inside the template. However it is still possible to broke the website by deleting a useful link. In this case I have two advice:\nKeep a version of the template in case you need to get back one of the files and then understanding why deleting these information is braking the website.\rDo not delete the files called _index.md, they are very useful to create the public site of the website.\r\r\r\rWhat‚Äôs next?\rThe websites created with the blogdown package from the R and stats community are united in a project called rbind. I hope to be one day expert enough to be part of this community and hopefully with my tricks and tips, you will as well ;)\n\r","date":1536019200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1536019200,"objectID":"4325d7054682143c838324406f820b55","permalink":"/post/publishing-blogdown-some-insights-from-my-own-experience/","publishdate":"2018-09-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/publishing-blogdown-some-insights-from-my-own-experience/","section":"post","summary":"Finally!

While the use of automatic systems has seen a steady increase over the last years, their classification results have not yet been systematically compared. The aim of this research was to test commercial software packages from Affectiva, Kairos and Microsoft companies in terms of their recognition accuracy. For this, we focused on spontaneous and dynamic facial expressions as provided by the DynEmo database ‚ÄìDisgust, Fear, Joy, and Surprise. In order to compare the classification results, we calculated the systems‚Äô ratio of True positives (only the target label is recognised), False positives (the target label as well as a non-target label is recognised), True negatives (no label is recognised) and False negatives (target label is not recognised whereas a non-target label is). The results of the comparison between the systems showed comparable detection rates in term of True positives and False positives. However, their detection rates of False negatives and True negatives significantly differed between the different recognition systems. Specifically, systems were not equal in their tendency to detect non-target labels erroneously as well as in their tendency to not detect any emotion label. When examining emotion recognition accuracy for each video/emotion, videos with higher recognition accuracy were those that depicted as joyful facial expression.

These results suggest that systems are not equivalent in their ability to detect specific spontaneous emotions.

Affective computing aims to create systems and algorithms that automatically analyse people\u0026rsquo;s emotional state. Consequently, several companies such as Affectiva, Beyond Verbal and Audeering have developed automatic systems to analyse the vocal expression of emotions. However, little is known about the accuracy of such systems. To evaluate the accuracy of automatic emotion recognition from voice, we processed vocal expressions from the GEMEP database with \u0026ldquo;SensAI Emotion\u0026rdquo; developed by Audeering. The GEMEP database contains audio-video recordings from 10 actors performing 17 different emotional scenarios (B√§nziger \u0026amp; Scherer, 2010). SensAI Emotion analyses emotions from speech and renders a value for 23 affective states and for valence and arousal dimensions (Eyben, Scherer, \u0026amp; Schuller, 2018). In terms of category recognition, the accuracy of SensAI labeling GEMEP vocal expressions of emotion is 6.67%. However, this low result is partly due to the high number of different affective state labels recognized. To bypass this label matching bias, we compared the recognition accuracy for valence and arousal dimensions. The results show an accuracy of 0.56 (CI95%[0.46,0.65]) for valence and 0.73 (CI95%[0.64,0.81]) for arousal recognition. Vocal automatic emotion recognition is a growing research area in affective computing. The categorical recognition of emotion remains a challenge due to the diversity of affective states. However, the accuracy of a system like SensAI Emotion provides promising results in the recognition of valence and arousal.\n","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"0bf85825180a75dcb9d3cd7d3ddb6da9","permalink":"/talk/2019-isre/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2019-isre/","section":"talk","summary":"ABSTRACT: Voice is one of the main communicative sources of evidence in interpreting the expression of emotion.

To reduce the risk of being rejected by its target users, the field of psychology has examined the determinants of the emotional user experience generated by a product. The emotion felt by the user is indeed a key factor that will influence the use of a product. This paper presents the different methods for measuring emotions. A literature review will compare the studies measuring the emotions of potential product users, the type of measures they use and their main results. This literature review reveals that despite the importance of measuring the emotions of users to predict the success of products, few of them are performed on real products on the one hand and with a hypothetical-deductive approach on the other. Although the factor structure of emotional user experience is not yet explored, this framework is relevant for understanding the role of users‚Äô emotions in their adoption of innovative products.","tags":null,"title":"Cadres et m√©thodes d‚Äôanalyse des √©motions suscit√©es par des produits innovants : Une revue bibliographique","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["R"],"content":"\rR Markdown\rThis is an R Markdown document.

It contains dynamic and natural emotional facial expressions (EFEs) displaying subjective affective states rated by both the expresser and observers. Methodological and contextual information is provided for each expression. This multimodal corpus meets psychological, ethical, and technical criteria. It is quite large, containing two sets of 233 and 125 recordings of EFE of ordinary Caucasian people (ages 25 to 65, 182 females and 176 males) filmed in natural but standardized conditions. In the Set 1, EFE recordings are associated with the affective state of the expresser (self-reported after the emotion inducing task, using dimensional, action readiness, and emotional labels items). In the Set 2, EFE recordings are both associated with the affective state of the expresser and with the time line (continuous annotations) of observers' ratings of the emotions displayed throughout the recording. The time line allows any researcher interested in analysing non-verbal human behavior to segment the expressions into emotions.","tags":null,"title":"DynEmo: A video database of natural facial expressions of emotions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michel Dubois","Damien Dupr√©","Jean-Michel Adam","Anna Tcherkassof","Nadine Mandran","Brigite Meillon"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1362096000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1362096000,"objectID":"79e32558600c5d7635fb96d24cd7a99a","permalink":"/publication/2013-interface-jmui/","publishdate":"2013-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2013-interface-jmui/","section":"publication","summary":"The use of facial interfaces in distant communications highlights the relevance of emotional recognition. However researches on emotional facial expression (EFE) recognition are mainly based on static and posed stimuli and their results are not much transferable to daily interactions. The purpose of the present study is to compare emotional recognition of authentic EFEs with 11 different interface designs. A widget allowing participants both to recognize an emotion and to assess it on-line was used. Divided-face and compound-face interfaces are compared with a common full frontal interface. Analytic and descriptive on-line results reveal that some interfaces facilitate emotional recognition whereas others would decrease it. This study suggests that relevant interfaces could improve emotional recognition and thus facilitate distant communications.","tags":null,"title":"The influence of facial designs interfaces on dynamic emotional recognition","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Damien Dupr√©","Mathieu Loiseau","Hamad Salem","Philipe Dessus","Stephan Simonian"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1351728000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1351728000,"objectID":"c78336291ffe032fef2b23895aff8a3b","permalink":"/publication/2012-critere-re/","publishdate":"2012-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2012-critere-re/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Quelques crit√®res d‚Äôutilisation d‚Äôun outil d‚Äô√©valuation automatique de synth√®ses de cours √† distance","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Philipe Dessus","S.
