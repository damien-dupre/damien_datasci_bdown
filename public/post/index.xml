      <description>Like every good movies, my previous blog post “Time series clustering with Dynamic Time Warping” deserves a sequel. In this Part 2, I will have a look at the athletes’ training plan for a marathon. Because marathons are such a demanding performance, most of athletes have a specific training plan to follow in order to be prepared. Many different training plan can be found on the web such as this one from the website www.</description>

      <description>Recently I was asked to make a short presentation about how to introduce the idea of statistical test and statistical significance to students in marketing. The timing was very good because I just had red a blog post written by Stephen B. Heard called Why do we make statistics so hard for our students? which is exactly the way to follow. So I taken the main idea of this post and made a short presentation with R that you can find here:</description>

      <description>Many solutions for clustering time series are available with R and as usual the web is full of nice tutorials like Thomas Girke’s blog post, Rafael Irizarry and Michael Love’s book, Andrew B. Collier’s blog post, Peter Laurinec’s blog post, Dylan Glotzer’s lecture or Ana Rita Marques’s module.

I’m always amazed by the possibilities offered by R and Rstudio and my first lines will thank this huge community which make the awesomeness real. However it’s not always easy to use and to apply these magnificent tools. Publishing a blogdown is a good example of a process that looks easy on the first sight but which can be tricky.</description>
