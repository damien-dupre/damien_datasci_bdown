      <description>LTfLL created next-generation educational services for learners and tutors, making extensive use of Language Technologies. The project created next-generation support and advice services to enhance individual and collaborative construction of knowledge in educational and organisational settings. The project made extensive use of language technologies and cognitive models in the services. The technical infrastructure allows deployment of these services in Personal Learning Environments (PLEs) as well as in institutional Learning Management Systems (LMSs).</description>
